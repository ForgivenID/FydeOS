# FydeOS
FydeOS is a Lua based Operating system built for Scrap Computers mod in Scrap Mechanic.

Its implementation features a Kernel, that allows you to create an OS yourself by utilizing the API-like table of methods and classes that are passed to any program launched by the kernel.

TODO:
* Kernel file system
* Loading custom made libraries
* Loading a main program (OS itself)
* Handler override (Allow the OS to change drivers, and when unloaded fall back to the kernel ones)
* FydeOS file system handler with privileges, timestamps and arbitrary data storage.
* Code preprocessing (Find a way to parallelism)
* Processes and services
* ...
